# twark

Small-scale Twitter crawling and archiving.

Like an ark, two of a kind, seven of another, no more.


## Twitter API choices

- [anaconda](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda) ([GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda)):
  Seems like the top pick for Twitter REST API calls (supports v1.1, OAuth only).
  As of today, last commit was 24 days ago.
- [twittergo](https://github.com/kurrik/twittergo):
  Not recently updated; last commit was 7 months ago.
- [twitterstream](https://github.com/hoisie/twitterstream):
  Seems like top pick for streaming API calls, but I haven't tried it out yet.

This project currently uses anaconda.
